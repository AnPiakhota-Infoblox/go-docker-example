# go-docker-example

A small example of building and running a Go app inside of a Docker container.

- Runs `go test` during build
- Uses Docker's multi-stage builds
- Builds and runs (as an example) on Travis CI
- Uses Coveralls for test coverage history

## Running Locally

Be sure to have Go installed and try running:

```bash
go run main.go
```
